# MyReads Project

My-Reads, is an internet app that helps someone keep track of the books he has read. This project was not built from scratch, a starter code provided by Udacity was used. The task was, to take that static, starter code and turn it into an interactive and functional app using react.js

## Get started

To run the app locally, navigate in the directory you want to place it and:

* clone the current repository
* navigate in the project's repository
* install all project dependencies with npm install
* start the hosting server with npm start

## Code dependencies
* Udacity's starter code provided through the repository
* The react.js library and all the packages it comes with when initializing a project through facebook's create-react-app package
* The react-router package

## How to use

The app comes with a home page which contains your "shelved" books, to move a book around shelves, or delete it, click it's dropdown menu and select the desired option. To add new books, go to the search page by clicking the icon on the right bottom. Search for books and add them into a shelf by their dropdown menu.
